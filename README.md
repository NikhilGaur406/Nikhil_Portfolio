## Android App Rating Prediction

### Dataset: budget, genres, keywords, movie overview, tagline, revenue, runtime, vote_count

#### possible keywords include based on novel, united states, spy, dc comics, marvel comic, etc.

## [Movie Recommender System](https://github.com/NikhilGaur406/RecommenderSystems)
This is my first attempt at a recommender system trying to recommend movies to users based on collaborative filtering

I am working on adding a content based filtering approach towards this dataset and in the future I will apply deep learning as well.

## [App Rating Predictor](https://github.com/NikhilGaur406/AndroidAppRating)
This is a regression problem I solved as final project for undergrad, some of the areas I wanted to work on were using average app sentiment for , I also tried to heavil rely on reviews and installs to get the best results.
## [Image Classification Projects](https://github.com/NikhilGaur406/DogCatClassifier)
#### [Dog vs Cat classifier](https://github.com/NikhilGaur406/ImageClassificationProjects/blob/master/Dog_Cat_Image_Classifier.ipynb) 

This project is about creating an image classifier using CNNs to differentiate between dogs and cats.

#### [Basic Cifar 10 model](https://github.com/NikhilGaur406/ImageClassificationProjects/blob/master/Cifar_First_CNN_Model.ipynb)

This problem was just my foray into Computer Vision

## [Natural Language Processing Projects](https://github.com/NikhilGaur406/NLPProjects)
### [Product Classification](https://github.com/NikhilGaur406/NLPProjects/blob/master/Product%20Classification.ipynb)
Problem still ongoing...

The purpose of this project is to determine the label id of a product based on features such as product description, size, resnet image classification results, retailer, etc.

The main problem to solve with this dataset is the class imbalance, there are many products with the class "OUT OF SCOPE".

There are different variables that I can use to tackle this issue, the breadcrumbs field talks about the different retail sections this specific product moved through, the product name is a pretty good indicator, of how to differentiate between different product types.

Another problem is definitely determining volume size from the pack size, would definitely need some sort of entity extractor for volume or count there

The description is definitely a good area to start as well, would definitely try to use some topic modeling to see what I can glean from there.
