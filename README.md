#       **My Projects**



## [App Rating Predictor](https://github.com/NikhilGaur406/AndroidAppRating)
This is a regression problem I solved as final project for undergrad, some of the areas I wanted to work on were using average app sentiment for , I also tried to heavil rely on reviews and installs to get the best results.


## [Image Classification Projects](https://github.com/NikhilGaur406/DogCatClassifier)
#### [Dog vs Cat classifier](https://github.com/NikhilGaur406/ImageClassificationProjects/blob/master/Dog_Cat_Image_Classifier.ipynb) 

This project is about creating an image classifier using CNNs to differentiate between dogs and cats.

#### [Basic Cifar 10 model](https://github.com/NikhilGaur406/ImageClassificationProjects/blob/master/Cifar_First_CNN_Model.ipynb)

This problem was just my foray into Computer Vision
