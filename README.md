This is my data science portfolio showcasing all my projects

## [**Project1: Political Text Classifier**](https://github.com/NikhilGaur406/Political-Text-Classifier)

I was interested in working on Natural Language Processing projects, and I was interested in applying data analytics and machine learning to a political dataset.

### **Technologies Used**

#### **Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, and Tensorflow**

**Data Collection:**

Data was collected from Reddit using several right and left leaning subreddits such as Conservative, LateStageCapitalism, StuffPoliticsSays, StuffLiberalsSay, democrats, Republican, Impeach_Trump, esist, and Liberal

**Preprocessing**

- Deleted posts that had the values '[removed]', and '[deleted]'
- Deleted moderator and bot generated posts

**Modeling**

- Tried using bag of words, custom word embeddings, and BERT, with BERT performing the best
- Used Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and other classificaiton techniques to get best result
- Best model was Neural Network trained with 300 epochs, at batch_size of 500   

## **Political Keyword Analysis**

The goal here was to see what kind of words popped up with word cloud

- I queried entire dataset to find most common words regarding certain topics such as Trump, Biden, Covid, etc.



## [**Project2: Used Car Price Predictor**](https://github.com/NikhilGaur406/CragislistVehicles)

This project was my first attempt at a regression problem, and I aim to predict the price of a used car  on Craigslist.

### **Technologies Used**
#### Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Seaborn

### **Process** 

Filled in missing values, analyzed data through visuals, and created several models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGboost with Random Forest performing the best
